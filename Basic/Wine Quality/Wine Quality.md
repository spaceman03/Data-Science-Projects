# Wine Quality Prediction
## :page_with_curl: About
This is my repository for Wine Quality Prediction. I used a random forest classifier model to predict the wine quality based on other indicators, such as pH, fixed acidity and etc.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Problem Statement
How accurate can a random forest classifier model predict the quality of a wine?

## :bookmark_tabs: Conclusion
The random forest classifier model can classify the quality of wine into 2 categories (good quality or not) with an accuracy of 0.8.

## :bulb: What I Learnt
- Using the sklearn library to train a random forest classifier model
