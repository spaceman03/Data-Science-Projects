# Wine Quality Prediction
## :page_with_curl: About
This is my repository for Wine Quality Prediction. I used a random forest classifier model to predict the wine quality based on other indicators, such as pH, fixed acidity and etc.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Problem Statement
How accurately can a random forest classifier model predict the quality of a wine?

## :bookmark_tabs: Conclusion
The random forest classifier model can classify the quality of wine into 2 categories (good quality or not) with an accuracy of 0.8. We also noticed that after hyperparameter tuning, we improved our accuracy from 0.8855 to 0.8911. By choosing the optimal parameters, we can improve our prediction.
